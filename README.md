System-specific notes
---------------------
The codes of networks were tested using PyTorch 1.13.1 version (CUDA 11.7) in Python 3.8 on Ubuntu system.

How to use it?
---------------------
Here an example experiment is given by using **Indian Pines hyperspectral data**. Directly run **main.py** functions with different network parameter settings to produce the results. Please note that due to the randomness of the parameter initialization, the experimental results might have slightly different from those reported in the paper.

When executing **main.py**, please take note of the `flag` on line 87 and the `dis` on line 90. When `dis` is set to `True`, the numbers `1`, `2`, and `3` in the `flag` correspond to the **Indian Pines hyperspectral data**, **Pavia University**, and **Houston**, respectively. When `dis` is set to False, the number `1` in the `flag` indicates the **Salinas**.

For other datasets, you can make your own settings in **generate_pic.py**.

Please kindly be careful on assigning arguments such as `num_epochs` on line 114. 

When the dataset is **Indian Pines hyperspectral data** & **Pavia University**, `num_epochs` is set to 1000 and when the dataset is **Houston** & **Salinas**, `num_epochs` is set to 500.

For the datasets of **Pavia University** and **Houston**, you can download the data we use from the following links of google drive or baiduyun:
